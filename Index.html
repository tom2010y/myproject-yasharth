                <h5 class="text-success text-capitalize">Our campus was established in March 2004</h5>
                <p class="text-muted">ISL is located on protected woodland and housed in purpose-built facilities in its own grounds. The building was designed in the 1970s as a French middle school, with light and spacious rooms grouped in clusters around a central atrium.
                    Primary and Secondary school each have their own area, but share the library and the art and music rooms. As well as taking place in the gym, many of our sports activities take place outdoors in a local stadium or in the state-of-the-art gym and swimming pool of the neighbouring districts. Our outdoor premises include a large upper playground, a multi-sport astro-turf playing field and a small amphitheatre.
                    The building, which is rented from local city authorities (La MÃ©tropole), was designed in the 1970's as a French middle school (11-16 year olds) and includes light and spacious class and work rooms grouped in clusters over 6 half-floors. There are dedicated facilities for art and design, music and movement and ICT, a large, well-equipped library and a small gym for primary school P.E. and Enrichment Activities. Our outdoor premises include a primary playground, a new multi-sports astro-turf playing field, a small amphitheatre  and attractive grassed areas. The older children have access to various municipal playing fields, an athletics stadium and a large state-of-the-art gymnasium nearby for their sports lessons. We are also usually able to offer swimming sessions to some of our younger primary students in a nearby municipal pool.</p>
